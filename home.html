      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>I love my baby so much I can't stop thinking about you throughout the day.
        I wake up and think about my baby, I eat breakfast and think about my baby, I go toilet and I think about
        my baby, I go in the shower and just think about my precious baby. I think she's the most beautiful person
        in the entire universe with her beautiful eyes, precious smile and magnificent hair.

      <h2>Our Story</h2>
       <p>When I first saw you, my eyes lit up on fire because I have just seen the most gorgeous big eye glasses Fijian Indian girl with thick ass 
        thighs and a voluptuous ass, sitting in the Kmart break room. I knew from that moment I was going to make my moves on her. Spit her the most immaculate rizz
        of all time. Yes, I decided to sit across her on the same table because I wanted to get to know my future wife. From that day on, I was so excited 
        to go into work and flirt with my beautiful coworker. But sadly, I never saw her again. Until a mircale that not even Santa was involved in, my birthday
        on the first of March 2022, I saw her standing at the registers being harassed by customers. I decided to walk up to her and hit her with a pool noodle,
        and from that day on I knew I wanted to use my own pool noodle to hit inside her. The very first time we flirted properly was on my birthday where
        she asked if it was my birthday jokely, not knowing it was actually my birthday until I showed her my driver's license. This past year have been the most amazing year of my life
        and we have done and accomplish so much from her graduating high school, celebrating her 18th, going to our first rave, concert and the best comdey show. 
        Can't forget about our very most incredible date at the zoo where she fell in love with me and made me an album in your camera roll.
        Not to mention, have the most incredible, sensational and steamy sexual intercourse. Our coitus just keeps getting better and better everytime,
        I just love making you finish. I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her
        and give her the best life she wanted.

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>This has been the longest two days of my life, I can't even put it into words. I hate not being called your boyfriend and hate how I can't call
        you my girlfriend. This time apart has made me realise that nothing in this world is worth losing the love of my life and not having you in my life. I understand
        now that I have to let my ego and bad habits go in order for us to move forward and better our relationship. I know I am very emotional and needy, and
        whenever we get into an altercation, I will take a step back and think with my head and before my emotions so I can communicate clearer for you. Thank you for 
        being the most paitent, loving and caring girlfriend in the entire cosmos. I could not have asked for anyone else to go through life than you.
